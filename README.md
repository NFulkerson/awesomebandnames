This is a free and open source list of awesome band names. You are free to use the names in this list for any purpose whatsoever. 

Awesomeness of band names not guaranteed.

**What is this?**
This is a project that I started a few years ago for myself - a list of all the phrases I read and said that made me think "Y'know, that'd be a good name for a band."
Since then it has grown significantly, to the point where there is no way I will ever be able to use all of these names in some kind of project. Thus, I turn them over to you. Use them wisely.

**HOW TO ADD BAND NAMES OF YOUR OWN**

1. Fork this repository.
2. Make changes to your version. Add your band name to the bottom of the "Chronological Order" list, then add your band name to where it belongs in the "Alphabetical Order" list. 
3. Submit a pull request. 
4. If I think your band names are sufficiently awesome to be added to the list, they will be. 

For best results, add only one band name per pull request.
